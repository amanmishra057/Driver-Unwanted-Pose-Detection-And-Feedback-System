# Driver-Unwanted-Pose-Detection-And-Feedback-System

A real-time AI-based system to monitor driver posture using computer vision and provide feedback to avoid risky or unwanted poses.

---

## 🚗 Project Overview

This system uses **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV** to analyze video frames in real time, detect the driver’s pose, and flag “unwanted” or dangerous poses (e.g., slouching, leaning, or distracted posture). It can be used to improve driving safety by alerting drivers when they adopt unsafe positions.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time pose estimation using deep learning  
- Driver posture analysis at **5–8 FPS**  
- Detection of unsafe/unwanted poses  
- Feedback mechanism (alerts or logging)  
- Lightweight and optimized for deployment on consumer hardware  
- Data storage via **SQLite**

## 🧪 Technologies & Tools

- **TensorFlow** — for the pose estimation model  
- **OpenCV** — for video capture and image processing  
- **SQLite** — lightweight database to log pose data or event history  
- **Python** — main programming language
